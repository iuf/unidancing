# UniDancing Competition Rules (Draft)

UniDancing consists of three components: tricks, artistics and choreography. Those three are the scoring's foundation. Tricks and artistics are the athletic base and choreography connects them.

## Goals of a Routine

The routine consists of a frame (theme/topic, acting, emotions, sense of movement, ...), the content which is structured in the choreography and the technical representation (expression of the content through body and tricks technics). Optionally there can be a message transported with the routine.

## Judging Contents

Each value, except stated differently, is judged as index, means there are maximum 100%, which is the equivalent to 10 points and 0% are 0 points. The weighing is done afterwards in the formula.

### Tricks

Difficulty, quality and mastery judge tricks.

#### Difficulty (10 points)

Measured is the overall difficulty, the mean of each tricks difficulty.

| Value | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 100% | All Tricks are on the highest niveau |
| 50% | Alle Tricks are on average Niveau |
| 10% | Alle Tricks are easy |

#### Quality (10 points)

Quality says _how_ same tricks are executed by different riders. Measured is the overall quality, the mean of each tricks quality.

| Value | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 100% | All Tricks are of high quality |
| 50% | All Tricks are of average quality |
| 10% | All Tricks executed very badly |

#### Mastery (10 points)

Mastery shows the control, the rider has about his tricks. Riders receive a penalty for falling off the unicycle or regain balance movements. The base value is 10 and each penalty reduce this score. 

| Penalty | Deduction |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Regain balance movement | 0,25 |
| Minor dismount | 0,5 |
| Mejor dismount | 0,75 |

### Choreography

Choreography is measured with a checklist. Scored points are summed up to get the total value.

### Artistics

Artistics is about how well the contents of a routine are expressed through body movements, mimics and gestures and if these motions are of high quality.

### Body Language (10 points)

Body language expresses the content of the routine. Also frequency and presence of the content throughout the whole routine.

| Value | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 10 | Content is completely understandable through body langauge and present all the time. |
| 5 | Either content is understandable through body language or presence all the time but not both. |
| 0-1 | Neither content is understandable through body language nor presence at all. |

### Quality (10 points)

Quality is about the execution of moves. Criteria, next to others, are body tension and a necessary amplitude. The more clear and distinctive a move can be recognized the better.

| Value | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 10 | Moves are of high quality, body tension is always present. |
| 6 | Moves are almost of high quality, body tension is almost always present. |
| 4 | Moves are only indicated but not finished in its full amplitude. Body tension is rarely seen. |
| 0-1 | Moves are of low quality, no body tension. |

## Judging

Judging happens in two groups. One group judges tricks (T1-5), second group judges choreography and artistics (A1-5).

## Evaluation

Tricks ans artistics as athletic components are weighted twice the value than choreography. The maximum value is 50 points:

Tricks = (difficulty + quality + mastery) / 3<br>
Artistics = (body language + quality) / 2<br>
Routine score = 2 * tricks + 2 * artistics + choreography

The rider with the highest score wins.
